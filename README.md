### This is a collection of some of my early Machine Learning Projects-
* There are three projects in this file
1. A dog and cat image classification algorithm
2. Using YOLO to distinguish between different cars and then using graph-theory to find the best arrangement of traffic lights
3. Weather prediction based on a given set of parameters.
